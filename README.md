# T2-Modulith

The T2-Modulith is an implementation of the [T2-Project](https://t2-documentation.readthedocs.io/) as a monolith.
It has still a modular structure enforced by [Spring Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith). Therefore, we call it *T2-Modulith*.

You can find more information about the migration from the microservices implementation to a monolithic implementation in the [Architecture documentation](https://t2-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/monolith/arch.html).

## Build and Run

Refer to the [Deployment documentation](https://t2-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/monolith/deploy.html) on how to build, run or deploy the T2-Modulith application.

## Usage

Refer to the [Usage documentation](https://t2-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/monolith/use.html) on how to use the T2-Modulith application. There are two ways: via the UI or via the HTTP API endpoints.

Some *usage scenarios* are defined as yaml files in the subdirectory [./usage_scenarios](./usage_scenarios/README.md)`. They are used for energy measurements.

## Application Properties

You can configure many properties used at start and during runtime of the T2-Modulith application.

There are different property files located at `./src/main/resources/application-*.yaml`.

Depending on your active Spring profiles, different property files are used. See e.g. documentation section [Run in development mode](https://t2-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/monolith/deploy.html#run-in-development-mode) on how to use the profile `dev`.

**T2 configuration:**

| property                      | read from env var             | description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| t2.cart.TTL                   | T2_CART_TTL                   | time to live of items in cart (in seconds)                                                      |
| t2.cart.taskRate              | T2_CART_TASKRATE              | rate at which the cart checks for items that exceeded their TTL (in milliseconds)               |
| t2.inventory.size             | T2_INVENTORY_SIZE                | number of items to be generated into the inventory repository on start up                       |
| t2.inventory.TTL              | T2_INVENTORY_TTL              | time to live of reservations (in seconds)                                                       |
| t2.inventory.taskRate         | T2_INVENTORY_TASKRATE         | rate at which the inventory checks for reservations that exceeded their TTL (in milliseconds).  |
| t2.payment.provider.enabled   | T2_PAYMENT_PROVIDER_ENABLED   | boolean value, defaults to true. if false, no connection to payment provider is made.           |
| t2.payment.provider.timeout   | T2_PAYMENT_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT   | timeout in seconds. the payment service waits this long for an reply from the payment provider. |
| t2.payment.provider.dummy.url | T2_PAYMENT_PROVIDER_DUMMY_URL | url of the payment provider.                                                                    |

Setting either `TTL` or `taskrate` to a value less or equal to zero disables the collection of expired entries (cart module and inventory module).
